My father said never give up son
Just look how good Cassius become
Mohammed, Mahatma and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

Now you could run and just say they're right
No, I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

Now you could run and just say they're right
No I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

Yeah you could be
Someone special
You've got bright in your brains
And lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone

In you I see
Someone special
You've got fire in your eyes
And when you realize you'll go further
Than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

I pay my intuition
I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient
It felt I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k
But I'm trying to turn K's to M's, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby
Like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself
But honestly, it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent until we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it
Feel my heart racing
Success I taste it
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

Yeah you could be
Someone special
You've got fire in your eyes
I see heaven inside
You'll go further than we've ever gone

In you I see
Someone special
You've got bright in your brains
You can break through those chains
You'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

In you I see
Someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on
And you can't go wrong
